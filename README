This is the README file for Tk::WaitBoxFixed

This is based on and compatible with Tk::WaitBox, but with a few
bugfixes applied.

Tk::WaitBox is a perl5 package which implements a very flexible
WaitBox widget.  To use Tk::FileDialog, you will need Perl version
5.002 or better, and Tk.

To build this extension, simply enter:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

There are no test routines for Tk::WaitBoxFixed.  A sample program is
included within the WaitBox.pm pod section.
